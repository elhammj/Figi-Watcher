# Figi-Watcher
It is a windows-based application. The main goal of our smart software is to control and track products in a feasible way no matter how many products the user wants to store in it. The application is an embedded system where the software and hardware works together to accomplish its function by implementing these activities:

* An image of a product is captured when it is moved in front of the camera.
* Expiry date is entered either automatically (using OCR – Optical Character Recognition algorithm) or manually depending on many criteria.
* The optimal min and max temperature degree can be controlled to monitor a product item which does not have a specific expiry date.
* Insertion and ejection date to/from the reregister is automatically entered with an option to enter additional information manually.
* A temperature sensor outside the refrigerator measures the room’s temperature and gives the user some suggestions about the best degrees to save the product.
* Alarm and Notifications messages appears to notify the user about the expired items.
* Other Facilities like, list all available items, list all expired items and show the current temperature.
